# GMT_tools
The The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) is very popular and useful for gelogist and geophysicst in plotting maps. 
In this project, I put some tools I wrote with matalb, powershell (adaptable for windows users) and bash. There 
are different formats of morphological data file. In this manual I gave a quick introduction on these formats. 


## Input Data Files  
### .xyz format
```
.xyz is kind of point cloud file, with three colombs which are X, Y, and Z. The X, Y, and Z are normally as
longitude, latitude and elevation. X and Y can also be the corrdinate as horizontal and vertical. The colombs
are seperated by splace or TAB. To plot the .xyz file with the GMT, a grid file (.grd) is the prerequisite.
